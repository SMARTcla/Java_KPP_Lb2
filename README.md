Task number 1
Write a method that, given the full type name specified as a string, or an object of type Class, returns a string with its full description: the name of the package in which the class is defined, modifiers and the name of the class being parsed, its base class, the list of implemented interfaces, and also a list of all fields, constructors and methods declared in the class and their characteristics.
It should be provided that both primitive types and reference types can be passed to the program for analysis: arrays, classes and interfaces.
Write a console program and a program with a graphical user interface to test your work.

Task number 2
Write a method that, based on the received object, displays its state - a list of all fields declared in the class, along with their values, as well as a list of public methods declared in the class. The user can view this list, select only methods without parameters to call, call them on this object, and view the result of the call.

Task number 3
Write a method that receives an object, the name of the method as a string, and a list of parameters required to call the method. If the given method can be called on the given object, print the result, otherwise throw a FunctionNotFoundException.

Task number 4
Write a program that allows you to create one-dimensional arrays and matrices of both primitive and reference types specified at runtime. The program must be able to resize arrays and matrices while preserving values ​​and convert arrays and matrices to a string.

Task number 5
Write a program that demonstrates how to use "generic" dynamic proxy objects for method profiling (displays method evaluation time) and method tracing (displays method name, method parameters, and computed value).
